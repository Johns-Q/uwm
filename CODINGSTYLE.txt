Tabulators are 8 characters, but indentations are 4 characters.
Tabulators are always unexpanded.

The maximal line length is 79 characters.

Write {} always, even for single statements:

	if (expr) {
	    stmt;
	}

Use // for end of line comments.

See .indent.pro for indentation rules.

Enable ".git/hooks/pre-commit", which checks for trailing whitespaces.

Run "make indent" before sending patches or commit.
